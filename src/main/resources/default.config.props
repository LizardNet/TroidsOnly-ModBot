# TroidsOnly ModBot configuration properties file
# Please read this file carefully and modify as appropriate, as it controls the startup parameters of your bot.
# Unless otherwise noted, all properties expect a single string value.

# REQUIRED SETTINGS
# You must specify these values, or the bot will explode on you at startup.

# authToken: String - The bot authentication token provided by Discord.
authToken=

# OPTIONAL SETTINGS
# If these values are not specified, hardcoded defaults (shown below) will be used instead.
# Remember to uncomment the values if you wish to change them!

# fantasyString: String - Set this to the character (or string of characters) that will be expected to prefix commands
# sent to a text channel. Commands sent to the bot in a private message don't need to be prefixed. If left
# blank, defaults to "?". There is no restriction on the length of the fantasyString, but a single character is
# recommended. Example: If fantasyString is set to "?" and you want to call the "slap" command in a channel, you would
# say "?slap" in the channel. Note: If you want to use "=" as your fantasyString, escape it with a single backslash.
#fantasyString=?

# ownerUid: String - The numeric user ID of the user the bot should consider its owner and privileged to run all
# commands unconditionally.  Strictly speaking this isn't required, but you'll probably want to set this at least when
# you first run the bot, otherwise you won't be able to set it up!  You can specify multiple user IDs by separating them
# with commas.
#ownerUid=

# statefileName: String - The name (or possibly an absolute path to) the file to save the bot's state in.  Defaults to
# state.json.
#statefileName=state.json

# tubesDirectory: String - The name (possibly an absolute path to) the folder containing tubes.  Defaults to tubes.
#tubesDirectory=tubes
